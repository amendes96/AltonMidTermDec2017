Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
-Java Development Kit

What is IDE?
-Integrated Development Environment

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
-Eclipse, IntelliJ

Explain the entire java life cycle.
-Java code is written in text editor or in java IDE and saved as dot(.)java extension which is then compiled by using java compiler and create
a .class file. Class file contains bytecodes. The class file then load into the JVM using java loader. Finally JVM reads the bytecodes
in memory and translate them into machine code for us to see the output.

what is class?
-Class is a blueprint

What is object?
-Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
-Main Method

Why main is static?
-The main method is static because they can be invoked by the runtime engine without having to instantiate an instance of the parent class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-Interface: In interface we cannot declare a body. All methods in Interface are abstract. We can have multiple methods in abstract.
-Abstract class: In abstract class we have to implement the body. Abstract class can have non abstract methods. It can also have abstract method which is not implemented.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
-No, It's because we can't create an object in abstract class.


what is Access Specifier?
-Access Specifier just basically gives us access to the class


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-Object Oriented Programming System
Object Orientated Programming System.
-Encapsulation is data hiding
-Inheritance is a way to acquire properties from one class to another class
-Abstraction is implementation hiding
-Polymorphism is basically an ability to take on many forms. Two types of Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-Java API is a list of all the classes that are part of the Java Development Kit(JDK)


Does java support multiple inheritance?
-Yes but through interface only


What is method overloading and when it happens?
-In overloading we can have the same name but different parameters
It happens in compile time


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system.
The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the
program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.
-The Exceptions are handled using try and catch method


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-Static keyword that are used for share the same variable or method of a given class.
-Static variable:1)It's a variable that's associated with a class and not with the object of the class.
 		         2)Static variables are initialized only once.
-Static Method: 1)A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
                2) A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
                3) Static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
-Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited,
final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
For example if we declare final int x = 1; we wont be ble to change the value of x later on because we declared it as a final method.


What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
 -Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. It's a block
 -Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.


What is a constructor ?
-To initialize an object


What is "this" keyword in java ?
-this. is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.


What is "super" keyword in java?
-"Super" keyword is used to call the constructor, methods and properties of a parent class.
    -super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
    -super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
    -super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.


What is JVM stand for ?
-Java Virtual Machine


What version of java are you using?
-1.8


What is JAR stand for ?
-Java Archive is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and
resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.


What is compile time and run time?
-When an application is running, it is called runtime.
-The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program, this is referred to as compile time.


What is heap?
-Heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.


How java manage it's memory?
-Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
 in size while the application runs.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-Once a String object is created it cannot be changed
-StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object .
-StringBuilder allows manipulating character sequences by appending, deleting and inserting characters and strings.


What is Singleton class?
-Singleton class is to control object creation by keeping private constructor

What is Serialization and Deserialization?      //i didnt know what this was so i looked it up on google
-Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or
database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
-int and Integer both represents same number of values.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
-It's because we cannot change the object but we can change the refrence to an object

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-Constructor chaining is where we basically call one constructor from another constructor using java

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments.
-Parallel Garbege Collector is used for multi-threaded environments

What is JIT stands for?
-Just In Time Operator

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
-Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.
-Garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
-When an object is created its stored in the heap
-Stack creates a memory to the created object
